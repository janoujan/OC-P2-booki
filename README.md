 ### Turn a model into a website

## languages and tools

#### HTML5 / CSS3 only

## Scenario and requirements

You are starting your work-study program as a web developer at the start-up Booki.
The company wishes to develop a website that allows users to find
accommodation and activities in the city of their choice.
You are responsible for integrating the interface of the site with HTML and CSS code. For this, you work in
close collaboration with Sarah, the CTO, and Loïc, the UI designer.
Sarah sends you an e-mail to tell you about the progress of the project.

### CTO requirements's mail: 

Subject: Booki site models  
From: Sarah  
To you  
Good morning,
That's it, Loïc has finalized the desktop, tablet and mobile models of the site! You will be able to
to integrate. They are available as attachments on Figma. Remember to log in to Figma to
be able to see all the information about the elements of the model.

You will also find attached the folder containing all the images to be used on the site.    
So that the project is  very clear, Loïc and I have prepared a summary note for you which brings together the
specifications and technical constraints to be respected (see attachment).  
So that we can consult the site once finished, you will have to create a folder, compressed
in ZIP format, with:  
an “index.html” file containing all of the project’s HTML code;  
a “CSS” folder including a “style.css” file containing all the CSS code for the project;  
an “images” folder containing all the images used.  
Good luck with this project, and have a nice day!  
Sarah, CTO @Booki
